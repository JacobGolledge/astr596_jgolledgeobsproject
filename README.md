# astr596_jgolledgeobsproject

I uploaded the final part of the project into the wrong file, but it is still there for viewing. I don't know how to fix that
so I am adding a readme for clarification. Part one is in the the final directory within the repository while part 2 is in the
first file within the directory. Sorry for any confusion. Their are two part two notebooks but the FINAL part two that I submitted
for grading is in the first folder. It should also have a more recent time stamp of changes committed to it.
